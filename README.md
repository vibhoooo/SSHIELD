SSHIELD is a Email/Spam Detection model.
I have you Multinomial Naive Bayes's Algorithm to built this model and for vectorization I have used tfidf technique.
It is a high precison model with precision of 100 %.
It it trained on kaggle dataset -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset
I have used streamlit for creating a website.
It shows us the appliaction of NLP in the field of spam detection.
